This is a sample app to use the primer library and UI for payment tokenization. 
To be able to use the app, you need to add a secure.properties file at the root of the project with the primer api key,
in order to acquire a client token that gives you access to the primer API.
The file should contain the following information:

`PRIMER_API_KEY=<api_key>`

The app consists of a bottomsheet with payment options. Once the payment option is selected, the proper screen with data to fill will appear. 
To go back to the payment options sheet, simply press back.
