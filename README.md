This is a sample app to use retrofit 2, kotlin and compose. 
To be able to use the app, you need to add a secure.properties file at the root of the project with the primer api key,
in order to acquire a client token that gives you access to the primer API.
The file should contain the following information:

`PRIMER_API_KEY=<api_key>`

The app consists of a bottomsheet with payment options. Once the payment option is selected, the proper screen with data to fill will appear. 
To go back to the payment options sheet, simply press back.

Please checkout the demo.mp4 video to view a demo of the app!
